# Kaggle Competition: Invasive Species

Identifying invasive hyacinth flowers in images of forest scenes using computer vision.

First attempt: convolutional neural net (Keras with Theano backend) using images resized to 150 x 200 pixels: 68% accuracy. Definitely room for improvement.

Add VGG16 convolutional layer as first layer?
Train on larger images?
Identify regions/partitions of the image where flowers are located?
